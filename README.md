## Compilation
This project should be compiled using [Simple-Build-Tool](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) (SBT),
and includes all configuration files required to that purpose.

It requires the JavaFX library to be installed, which SBT can *not* do.
On Debian based systems, it can be found in the packages `openjfx` and `libopenjfx-java`.
